# Personal neovim config

Make sure you have [neovim](https://neovim.io/) installed. You can then run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gauthsvenkat/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim/
```

My configuration depends on [external tools that are managed by nix](https://github.com/gauthsvenkat/nixos/blob/main/components/common/terminal/neovim.nix). Make sure you have them installed before running `nvim`.
